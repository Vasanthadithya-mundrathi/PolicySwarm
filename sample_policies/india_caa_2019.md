# Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) 2019

## Policy Overview
The Citizenship Amendment Act, passed on 11 December 2019, fast-tracks Indian citizenship for persecuted religious minorities from Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Afghanistan who entered India before 31 December 2014.

## Covered Groups
Citizens of these religions from neighboring countries:
- Hindus
- Sikhs
- Buddhists
- Jains
- Parsis
- Christians

## Explicitly Excluded
- Muslims from any country
- Atheists
- Jews
- Other religious minorities

## Stated Objectives
1. Provide refuge to persecuted minorities
2. Reduce residency requirement from 11 years to 5 years
3. Protect minorities fleeing religious persecution

## Controversy Points

### Constitutional Concerns
1. **Article 14 Violation**: Equality before law (discrimination by religion)
2. **Secular Principles**: Citizenship based on religion, not persecution
3. **Arbitrary Exclusion**: Ahmadiyyas (persecuted Muslims) excluded
4. **Geographic Limits**: Why only 3 countries? (Sri Lanka, Myanmar ignored)

### Implementation Fears
1. **NRC Connection**: Combined with National Register of Citizens
2. **Detention Camps**: For those who fail to prove citizenship
3. **Muslim Targeting**: Selective documentation requirements feared
4. **Assam Concerns**: 1.9 million people in NRC limbo

## Citizen Responses

### Opponents
- Students at JNU, Jamia Millia Islamia
- Muslim organizations
- Civil society groups
- Opposition parties
- International human rights organizations

### Supporters
- BJP and allied parties
- Hindu nationalist groups
- Some minority refugees from covered countries

## Protests (2019-2020)
- Shaheen Bagh sit-in (100+ days)
- University campus protests nationwide
- Internet shutdowns in multiple states
- Section 144 imposed in several cities
- 100+ deaths during protests and police action
- Thousands detained

## Current Status
- **NOT REPEALED** despite protests
- Rules notified in March 2024 (4+ years after act passed)
- Legal challenges pending in Supreme Court
- Implementation ongoing

## Key Concerns for Testing
This policy remains highly divisive. Key debate points:
- Is religious-based citizenship constitutional?
- Should persecuted Muslims be included?
- What are ground-level implementation risks?
- How does it interact with NRC?
