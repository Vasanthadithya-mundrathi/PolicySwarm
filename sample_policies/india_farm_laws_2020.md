# Farm Laws 2020 (Repealed 2021)

## Policy Overview
The Indian government introduced three farm laws in September 2020, aimed at reforming the agricultural sector by liberalizing trade and allowing farmers to sell directly to private buyers outside of government-regulated mandis (markets).

## The Three Laws
1. **Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act**
   - Allows farmers to sell produce anywhere, including outside APMCs
   - Enables inter-state and intra-state trade barrier-free

2. **Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance Act**
   - Creates framework for contract farming
   - Pre-agreed prices between farmers and buyers

3. **Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act**
   - Removes items like cereals, pulses, oilseeds from essential commodities list
   - Allows hoarding without limits

## Eligibility
- All farmers across India
- Agricultural produce traders
- Private corporations and food processing companies

## Government's Stated Benefits
1. Freedom from APMC monopoly
2. Better prices through direct corporate deals
3. Modern technology and investment in agriculture
4. Reduced wastage through contract farming

## Concerns Raised by Citizens
1. **MSP Fear**: No guaranteed Minimum Support Price in law
2. **Corporate Exploitation**: Fear of large companies exploiting small farmers
3. **APMC Collapse**: Mandis become obsolete, no safety net
4. **Contract Farming Risks**: Corporations can manipulate prices
5. **Small Farmer Vulnerability**: No bargaining power against corporations
6. **Debt Crisis**: Risk of increased farmer indebtedness

## Who Opposed
- Farmers from Punjab, Haryana (major protest sites)
- Agricultural unions
- Opposition political parties
- Small and marginal farmers

## Who Supported
- Large agribusiness corporations
- Free market economists
- Some progressive farmers

## Outcome
**REPEALED** on 19 November 2021 after 13+ months of massive farmer protests at Delhi borders. Prime Minister announced withdrawal citing inability to convince a section of farmers.

## Key Protest Points
- Over 700 farmers died during protests
- Protests at Singhu, Tikri, Ghazipur borders
- International attention from celebrities and activists
- Republic Day tractor rally controversy
