# Community Charge Policy (1990)

## Policy Overview
Replace traditional property-based taxation with a flat-rate 'Community Charge' payable by every adult resident, regardless of income or property value.

## Objectives
- Simplify local taxation system
- Ensure all adults contribute to local services
- Reduce administrative burden on local councils
- Promote accountability in local government spending

## Eligibility
- All adults aged 18+ residing in the UK
- Exceptions: Full-time students (80% discount), severely mentally disabled persons (exempt)
- No income or property value thresholds

## Policy Details

### Charge Structure
- **Standard Rate**: £400/year per adult (example rate)
- **No income bands**: Same rate applies to all eligible adults
- **No property value consideration**: Flat rate regardless of residence type

### Collection Method
- Annual billing by local councils
- Payment options: lump sum or monthly installments
- Enforcement: Court summons for non-payment

### Revenue Allocation
- 100% to local council budgets
- Funds local services: waste collection, parks, libraries, policing

## Expected Benefits
1. **Fairness**: Everyone pays equally for local services they all use
2. **Simplicity**: One rate, easy to understand and administer
3. **Accountability**: Direct link between what residents pay and what councils spend
4. **Rural Equity**: Farmers and rural property owners no longer disproportionately taxed

## Known Concerns
1. **Regressive Impact**: Low-income households pay same as wealthy households
2. **Affordability**: Single parents, pensioners on fixed incomes struggle to pay
3. **Public Backlash**: Perceived as unfair to poorest citizens
4. **Enforcement Challenges**: Tracking transient populations, students

## Implementation Timeline
- **Phase 1** (Year 1): Pilot in select regions
- **Phase 2** (Year 2): National rollout
- **Phase 3** (Year 3): Full enforcement and refinement

## Success Metrics
- Revenue collection rate >90%
- Public satisfaction >60%
- Administrative cost reduction by 30%
- Compliance rate >85%

## Fallback Options
If policy fails to meet objectives:
1. Add income-based rebates for low earners
2. Introduce property value bands (similar to Council Tax)
3. Revert to traditional rates system
