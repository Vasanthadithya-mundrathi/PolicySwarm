# Demonetization Policy 2016

## Policy Overview
On 8 November 2016, the Government of India announced the demonetization of ₹500 and ₹1,000 banknotes, which constituted 86% of the currency in circulation. Citizens had 50 days to deposit old notes in banks.

## Stated Objectives
1. **Curb Black Money**: Force unaccounted cash into banking system
2. **Fight Counterfeit Currency**: Eliminate fake notes funding terrorism
3. **Promote Digital India**: Push cashless transactions
4. **Reduce Corruption**: Make large cash transactions difficult
5. **Tax Compliance**: Identify tax evaders with sudden deposits

## Implementation
- Immediate effect from midnight 8 November 2016
- Old notes invalid for transactions
- New ₹500 and ₹2,000 notes introduced
- ATM withdrawal limits: ₹2,000/day initially
- Bank deposit limits with KYC requirements

## Eligibility for Exchange
- All Indian citizens with valid ID
- NRIs with specific documentation
- Old notes exchangeable at banks until deadline

## Impact on Different Groups

### Severely Affected
- Daily wage workers (no cash for food)
- Street vendors (customer payments impossible)
- Farmers (harvest season cash crunch)
- Small businesses (90% of transactions cash-based)
- Rural population (no banking access)
- Wedding season families (prepaid vendors)

### Less Affected
- Urban professionals (digital payments)
- Salaried employees (bank transfers)
- Large corporations (mostly cashless)

## Reported Problems
1. **Cash Shortage**: ATMs empty for months
2. **50+ Deaths**: In bank queues, suicides
3. **GDP Drop**: Growth fell from 8% to 5.7%
4. **Job Losses**: 1.5 million jobs lost (CMIE estimate)
5. **Rural Crisis**: Farmers couldn't sell produce
6. **Business Closures**: Thousands of SMEs shut down

## RBI Report (2018)
- 99.3% of demonetized notes returned to banks
- Black money seized: Negligible
- Digital transactions: Temporary increase, then reverted

## Citizen Verdict
- Initial support due to anti-corruption messaging
- Support eroded as hardship increased
- Long-term impact on informal economy devastating
- Policy NOT reversed despite criticism

## Lessons
This policy demonstrates the gap between policy goals and ground reality. While the intent was anti-corruption, the implementation caused disproportionate suffering to the poor and informal sector workers.

*Case Study: A policy that was NOT reversed despite massive citizen hardship. Demonstrates importance of pre-implementation citizen feedback.*
