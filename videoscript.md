## 🎬 INTRO (0:00 - 0:20)

**[Show PolicySwarm logo/dashboard]**

> "Hi! I'm Vasanthadithya from Team H5X. This is PolicySwarm - a recursive consensus engine that ends bureaucratic opacity in government policies."

> "Citizens struggle to understand complex policies. They miss vital benefits because eligibility rules are confusing. We built an AI system that stress-tests policies before they go public."

---

## 🔧 THE PROBLEM (0:20 - 0:45)

**[Show a complex government policy document - maybe a PDF]**

> "Here's a typical government policy. Can you tell who's eligible? What benefits you get? Most citizens can't."

> "This leads to:
> - Missed benefits
> - Frustration
> - Bureaucratic delays
> - Loss of public trust"

**[Highlight the 4 key challenges from problem statement]**

## 💡 OUR SOLUTION (0:45 - 1:15)

**[Show 3-level architecture diagram]**

> "PolicySwarm solves this with a 3-level AI agent network:"

> "**Level 1: Citizen Swarm** - 10 diverse AI personas debate the policy. They have memory, emotions, and realistic Indian backgrounds - a teacher, a driver, a farmer, a student..."

> "**Level 2: Senate** - 3 government advisors analyze the citizen feedback. Trend Analyst, Economic Advisor, and Constitutional Expert."

> "**Level 3: Architect** - Synthesizes everything and rewrites the policy to address concerns."

---

## 🖥️ LIVE DEMO (1:15 - 2:45)

### Step 1: Upload Policy
**[Navigate to PolicySwarm dashboard]**

> "Let me show you how it works. I'll upload India's controversial Farm Laws 2020."

**[Drag and drop the farm_laws.md file]**

> "Watch the citizens start debating..."

### Step 2: Citizen Debate
**[Show citizen chat feed updating in real-time]**

> "See how Anjali, a teacher, worries about inflation. Raju, an auto driver, fears price instability. They reference each other - that's the memory system."

### Step 3: Senate Analysis
**[Show senate chat feed]**

> "Now the Senate advisors discuss. They analyze economic viability, constitutional concerns, and public sentiment trends."

### Step 4: Cycle Control
**[Show pause/continue/download buttons]**

> "I can pause the simulation, let it continue, or stop and download the revised policy anytime."

### Step 5: Download PDF
**[Click download button, show the professional PDF]**

> "And here's the final output - a professional PDF in Indian Gazette format with eligibility criteria, benefits, and citizen advocacy summary."

## 🔐 WHY LOCAL LLM? (2:45 - 3:00)

**[Show config.json briefly]**

> "We use Ollama locally by default. Why? Policy documents are sensitive. Before publication, they must stay confidential. Our approach ensures zero data leaves your machine."

> "You can switch to OpenAI, Gemini, or Blaxel if needed - it's configurable."

---

## ✅ ZYND FEATURES (3:00 - 3:20)

**[Show quick highlight of each feature]**

> "How do we use ZYND?"

> "**Functional Agent Networks** - 14 agents working together with defined roles and trust"

> "**Trust-Based Interoperability** - Agents reference each other, build on previous statements"

> "**Decentralized AI Governance** - Local LLM means no central authority controls the data"

---

## 🎯 CLOSING (3:20 - 3:40)

**[Show final dashboard with completed simulation]**

> "PolicySwarm: Because every policy deserves to be stress-tested by the people it will affect."

> "It delivers:
> - Policy Interpretation
> - Eligibility Verification
> - Benefit Matching
> - Citizen Advocacy"

> "Thank you! Team H5X."

3. **Pre-run:** Have a simulation partially complete so there's data to show
4. **Audio:** Clear voice, consistent volume
5. **Speed:** Don't rush - let the UI updates be visible
6. **B-roll:** Add the architecture diagram as an overlay during explanation
